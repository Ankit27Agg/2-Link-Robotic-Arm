# 2-Link-Robotic-Arm


# What is a 2-link Robotic Arm?
It is a Robotic Arm with 2 Degree of Freedom(DOF). It has two links which rotates in a 2-Dimensional plane with each of link having a single DOF.

In the figure, the robot consists of 2 links named as link1 and link2. The length of boh links are l1, l2 respectively. Link1 is fixed to horizontal and makes an angle θ1(theta1). Also link2’s one end is fixed to one end of link1 making an angle θ2(theta2) with horizontal.

Since robotic arm works in a two dimensional plane therefore axis used will be xaxis  and yaxis.


# Mathematical Model
Let us consider that the starting point coordinate of link1 is (X0, Y0) and the end point coordinate of link1 is (X1, Y1).
Similarly, starting point coordinate of link2 is (X1, Y1) and the end point coordinate of link2 is (X2, Y2).
